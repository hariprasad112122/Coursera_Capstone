    "\n",
    "The City of Toronto is the most populous city in Canada. The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada.

Its economy is highly diversified with strengths in technology, design, financial services, life sciences, education, arts, fashion, business services, environmental innovation, food services, and tourism.\n",

    "Due to its background, market is highly competitive and cost of doing business is obviously one of the highest.
